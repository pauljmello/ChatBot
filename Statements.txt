I have installed:
	pip install alpha_vantage

Each Virtual Assistant should have the following capabilities at a minimum:

    Ability to understand 20 user utterances/queries (including reasonable variations of those queries).
    Ability to have at least 2 multi-turn conversations where the user may ask follow up questions once the bot responds to their original query.
    Ability to collect data from the user, e.g., on what date did the issue occur, how many items did you have in your order, etc.
    Ability to engage in some amount of small talk (e.g., hi, how are you, etc.)

Stock Market Use Cases:
	Open Price
	High Price
	Low Price
	Close Price

	We can collect data from the user and recall a specific date from the past 1-2 months
	Every time the user utters a stock, we should attempt to save that specific data result until the end, such that a user can ask "how big of a change is that?"

	conda activate rasa_bot
	code .

	Train the model using: rasa train
